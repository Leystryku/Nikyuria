A cheat I created in 2013~2014.
I released it due to the customer breaking the non-disclosure, non-share, non-sale agreement & sharing information to a competitor. This lead me to release the code publically for everyone, so they could learn from it.

It has some "new" cheat features that the scene might appreciate ( aka will probably be c+pd into every generic cheat ), but since it's already happening with 1 cheat,
it doesn't really matter. (update as of 2020: my prediction was right, they're now c+pd into every generic cheat )

The cheat used to work for csgo, tf2, gmod, css and it probably would've worked for many others.

Use it for whatever you want, just make sure to credit me.
